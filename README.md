# AUT_DigitalControl_Project_ErebusMazeRobot_Webots

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Playing Erebus Maze using Webots" project, which is a part of our university's Digital Control course. The project focuses on implementing and simulating a maze-solving algorithm using the Webots simulation environment.

Overview
In this project, we aim to demonstrate our understanding of digital control concepts by developing a maze-solving algorithm and simulating it in the Webots environment. We have chosen to name our maze "Erebus Maze."

Features
Maze Generation: We have designed Erebus Maze using a custom maze generator. The maze is designed to challenge the maze-solving algorithm with varying levels of complexity.

Simulation Environment: The Webots simulation environment provides a platform for us to visualize and test our maze-solving algorithm in a controlled and realistic setting.

Maze-Solving Algorithm: We have implemented a digital control-based algorithm to guide an agent through Erebus Maze. The algorithm showcases our understanding of concepts covered in the Digital Control course.

# Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to our Digital Control course instructor and our fellow students for their support and collaboration in completing this project.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the maze, and learn about digital control concepts through this project. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
